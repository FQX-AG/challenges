# FQX Challenges

Welcome to the FQX Challenges repo.

If you're reading this you're most likely applying for a position at FQX. 
We wish you all the best and hope you'll have fun solving your challenge!

Depending on the role you're applying for, you will have been directed at a certain subdirectory that contains your challenge.

But for all of them we usually have relatively complex business requirements that match closely what you can expect to work on, when joining FQX.
So make sure you read them carefully and fully understand them.
During the interview or in an email you should have received contact information where you can direct clarifying questions to.

**We are looking for readable, scalable and maintainable code, one would call production-ready, and we will assume the deliverable is something you would also consider production-ready. As a frontend developer, we also expect you to deliver "tasty" UX and UI.**

**All the challenges you have a one-week deadline to completion. We estimate the total hours to completion to be around four hours.**
